                    breakfast, try to choose whole, unprocessed foods from each of the five food groups: fruits,
                    vegetables, grains, protein foods, and dairy. Try to include proteins from foods like yogurts (look
                    for varieties with less sugar added), eggs, nuts and seeds or legumes</p>

                    These foods each have specific benefits, and both are relatively low in calories for an average
                    serving. While chicken and brown rice can make up part of a healthy weight-loss diet, they won't
                    individually cause you to lose body fat.</p>
